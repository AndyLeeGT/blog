Hello! I'm Andy Lee, the mind behind Andy's Blog. Here, I blend my passions with the written word, sharing bits of life, insights, and adventures in Information Technology. 
My journey has been a mix of professional endeavors as a SOC Analyst and personal explorations in HomeLab.

This blog is my digital canvas for expressing thoughts on new Information Technology skills, peppered with stories and lessons learned along the way. 
It's a space for connection, inspiration, and sharing new information through the internet.

Outside of blogging, I usually enjoy swimming or dreaming up my next adventure. 
This blog is an invitation into my world, hoping to inspire and connect with fellow dreamers and doers.

Thanks for dropping by. Let's journey together!
